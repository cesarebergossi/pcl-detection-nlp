8192,poor-families,"ANNUAL State of Education Report ( ASER ) launched in Islamabad on Wednesday reveals some of the interesting facts and figures . It notes there has been progress in increasing access to education in Pakistan as the number of out-of-school children has dropped from 25 million to 22 million as per government data . However , more remains to be done . Without compromising on access to school , the focus should be on improving the quality . The education budget allocation is now 3.02% of GDP , up from 2.83% last year but is still short of the target . The down side of the situation is that 19% children aged 6-16 still remain out of school . The remaining 81% that are enrolled in the 6-16 age bracket are not learning much either . The seventh ASER survey report also highlighted as per past trends that children enrolled in private schools are performing better compared to those studying in government schools . The number of children out of school should be a cause for concern for the entire nation and especially the Federal and the Provincial governments . It is quite obvious that poverty is the main cause that keeps children away from schools and forces them to do some work to help supplement income of their families . The problem can be addressed to a great extent if number of government schools is increased meaningfully . Government schools charge little or no fee but these are not enough to cater to the needs of growing population . The distance factor and involvement of unbearable travelling expenses also prohibit parents from sending their children to schools . Private schools have mushroomed both in urban and rural areas and they are catering to the need of middle and high income segments of the society but poor families can not afford to get their kids admitted in these schools . Their owners should also realise they have social and national obligations as well and offer some percentage of total admissions to students from poorest of the poor families free of cost . There are also issues of facilities , qualifications of teaching staff and the quality of education being imparted and government should , at least , offer training facilities to all teachers including those employed by private schools .",0

But their plan was not to be . Caught and detained by the Yemeni authorities , the 600 or so men now await deportation , prevented from leaving their makeshift jail by armed soldiers . Conditions at the warehouse are growing increasingly desperate . Several days ago , the authorities stopped handing out food and basic supplies . "" I came from Djibouti to work . They used to give us small amounts of food . If there is no food , we will die , "" said one migrant who declined to give his name . "" If there is no solution , they will deport us to our countries or get us out of here "" , the man added . Yemen , the poorest country on the Arabian Peninsula , has long been a transit point for migrants and refugees from East Africa , many of whom are fleeing hunger and violence . The route was unsafe long before Yemen descended into all-out war in 2015 . Hundreds drown each year on the perilous sea journey , and those who make it face multiple risks , including death by "" assault , extortion and abuse by criminal networks , as well as the hazards stemming from the war in Yemen itself "" , according to UNHCR , the United Nations ' refugee agency . Despite these dangers , the number of migrants traveling across the Gulf of Aden and Red Sea to Yemen has been rising steadily , to 117,000 in 2016 from 92,000 in 2015 , according to UNHCR . Khaled al-Elwany , a local official who until recently oversaw the deportation of migrants back to their home countries , says up to 15,000 migrants are arrested at city checkpoints each month . Elwany says he was fired by the interior ministry for refusing to cooperate with a plan to relocate the center to a neighboring province and after authorities stopped food supplies . A ministry official told Reuters that the aim of the move to a new facility had been to improve conditions for the migrants while they await deportation . Saudi Arabia and a coalition of mostly Gulf Arab allies are fighting to restore Yemen 's exiled government to power and roll back the Iran-aligned Houthi movement . While the government nominally controls Aden and other southern areas , a budget crunch and rivalries with local armed groups mean its officials mostly reside abroad . State services and salaries have been hit hard by the chaos , and the African migrants appear to be a lower priority .
